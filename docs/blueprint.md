# **App Name**: SpectroControl

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Allow users to input spectrophotometer readings.
- Chart Generation: Generate control charts (e.g., X-bar and R charts) based on user data.
- Out-of-Control Detection: Implement rules for identifying out-of-control points on the control chart.
- Visual Alerting: Visually highlight out-of-control points on the generated charts.
- AI-Powered Suggestion Tool: Generate suggestions for possible causes of the identified issues, using a LLM to select appropriate causes for issues, based on context and readings. The LLM is used as a tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke precision, stability, and scientific rigor, important for analytical instrumentation. 
- Background color: A very light blue (#E8EAF6) to provide a clean and calm backdrop, improving readability and reducing eye strain.
- Accent color: A vibrant violet (#7E57C2) to draw attention to important interactive elements.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans or Roboto) for clear readability of data and labels.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different data functions and analysis types.
- Ensure the layout is well-structured with clear sections for data input, chart display, and control settings.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to smoothly update the charts and data displays.
